        		<ol style="color: gray;margin: 10px"><br>
        			<li>Don't read the whole passage as the time provided to you is limited.</li><br>
        			<li>Don't extend the time spent on one answer. Move to the next one, once you have answered. Do the same even if you don t know the answer to the question.</li><br>
        			<li>Don't try to segregate answers for every question. Some questions will be difficult while others will be easy. Try to work as per your strengths and weaknesses.</li><br>
        			<li>Divide the time for attempting the passage based questions. Assign 20 minutes for each reading. Time can be increased or decreased according to the complexity level of a passage.</li><br>
        			<li>Refrain from spending more than 25-30 minutes on a single passage. It is advisable not to procrastinate even for a minute while attempting the passage.</li><br>
        			<li>Each passage will have three to four different types of questions such as -- matching the headings, true or false, yes or no questions, matching paragraph information, summary completion, sentence completion, multiple choice, list selection, categorization questions, matching sentences endings, table completion, choose a title, flowchart and diagram completion and short answer questions.</li><br>
        			<li>Even if you have missed out an answer, try remembering any data that you can.</li><br>
